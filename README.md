.getignore ensures only relevent files are pushed, simply opening the folder with these files will cause unity to generate the rest of the needed files.

'Main Menu' is the default first scene.

Controls:
- 'A'/'D' or Left/Right arrow key to move left/right.
- 'Spacebar' to jump, release to end jump early, press again to wall jump or double jump (requires power up).
- 'S' or Down arrow key to crouch and pick up powerup.
- 'L' to dash.
- 'F' to thow fireball (requires power up).
- 'J' to physical attack enemy in fromt of player.
- 'Esc' to return to main menu.

Goal of the game is to move rom the left side of the level to reach the door on the right side of the level.

Collect as many gems as you can along the way.

Being hit by enimes or spikes will cause you to take damage and lose health (represented by cherries).

Regain heath by collecting cherries, if your health drops below 0 you reset the level losing nay gems you collected.

Defeat enimes by jumping on them, hitting them with fireballs (only with fireball powerup) or with physical attacks (currently no animation/cooldown).

If falling against a wall the player wills slide down it slowing their fall speed, the player can then jump again to wall jump.

Jump on a gravity pad to flip the players gravity and run on the ceiling.

Collect one of four powerups such as:
- Double Jump: jump a second time in the air (overides wall jump)
- Fireball: fire a fireball to defeat enimes.
- Double Health: Doubles the players health.
- Double Gems: Gives the player 2 gems every time they colect a gem.
Collecting a second power up will cause the first to disapear, so choose carefully.
